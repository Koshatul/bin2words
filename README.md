Binary to Words (Text) Conversion Tool

Created by Patrick Webster <patrick@aushack.com>

INTRODUCTION

The purpose of bin2words (Binary to Words) is a simple binary format to Words conversion tool. E.g. 0x41 = "2600" (string).

The point is just a bit of fun, really. It could be useful in obfuscating messages, similar to rot13, or transferring other data such as AVI files.

But the actual purpose is for myself to get a grasp of the differences between Subversion and Git, because I always screw up my Git changes.
